# ROS 2 time synchronization protocol

This is a ROS 2 node that helps provide time to embedded devices that don't have an RTC or network connection to set their clocks. This is useful for microcontrollers using Pico-ROS connected through serial links.

The protocol itself is patterned after NTP.

## Messages

The protocol is structured as follows:

1. The client sends a synchronization request.
    This is a message of type `std_msgs.msg.String` containing a token value. The default topic is `/sync_time_request`.

1. The server responds with a message of type `sensor_msgs.msg.TimeReference`.
    The `time_ref` value contains the server's timestamp at the time of request arrival. The `source` field contains the token of the original request. The default topic is `/sync_time_response`.

With that response, the client has the four timestamps needed to compute the RTT and time offset as defined by NTP.

## Client code

Example client code for a microcontroller can be found in [picorosso-espidf](https://github.com/xopxe/picorosso-espidf/blob/main/src/sync_time.cpp).

## Deployment

The reach of this protocol can be limited to the links of interest using Zenoh ACLs.
